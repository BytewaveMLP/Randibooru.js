> A Node.js port of [Randibooru](https://github.com/BytewaveMLP/randibooru)

Randibooru.js is my first experiment in Node.js. My goal is to attempt to port Randibooru, my old Python-based Discord bot, to discord.js on Node.

## Install

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (tested on v8.2.1)

### Installation

```bash
$ npm install # Install all dependencies
$ cp config.example.json config.json # Create a local config
$ $EDITOR config.json # Add your config options here
### NOTE: We assume your derpiAPIKey points to an account with the Everything filter set. If not, the bot will still work, but replies may be incorrect in terms of the amount of images matching a given query.
$ node ./src/randibooru.js # Run the bot
```

## Usage

### Commands list

- `rb!random [query]` - Get a random image from Derpibooru, optionally matching the given query.

(This also includes the list of built-in Discord.js commands, the likes of which I'm too lazy to list.)
